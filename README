Wacom Intuos Pro managing scripts

This is a set of scripts to set up and customize Wacom Intuos Pro tablets under Linux/X11/udev.
These scripts work for my Wacom Intuos Pro M tablet. They can require some modifications to work
with other similar models.

The set includes:

* 99-local.rules - Udev rules file, which runs wacom-setup.sh script when the tablet is attached.
  Note that for models other than Intuos Pro M, you will need to change idProduct parameter.
* wacom-setup.sh - Shell script which enables unpriviledged-user write access to the file under
  /sys/bus/usb/ hierarchy, which is responsible to toggling LEDs on the tablet (near the ring).
* wacom-switch-mode.sh - Shell script which toggles ring mode: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 ...
* install.sh - sample script that installs files described above to their intended locations.
